# simple-games
Showcase of some simple games I built with html canvas. 

### Games available
- Snake
- Tic Tac Toe

### Why this project?
I created this project because I recall really enjoying programming games and I wanted to learn how to do it using basic web technologies. I built snake and tic-tac-toe separately and then becan integrating them in this repo.

### Technologies used
I chose just to use html canvas and plain javascript to start so as to not overburden the project with frameworks. 

### Goals

Longer term I want to serve these games in a single-page application (I'll probably use Vue) but since my main focus is building out a multi-player capability for tic-tac-toe, a SPA refactor will have to wait.
