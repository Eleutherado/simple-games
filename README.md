# simple-games
Showcase of some simple games I built with html canvas. 

### Games available
- Snake
- Tic Tac Toe

### Why this project?
I created this project because I recall really enjoying programming games and I wanted to learn how to do it using basic web tools such as html canvas. I built snake and tic-tac-toe separately and then began integrating them in this repo.

### Technologies used
- Frontend: I chose just to use html canvas and plain javascript to start so as to not overburden the project with frameworks. 
- Backend: Node.js with express. Socket.io for websockets. 

### Goals
- [x] Build Snake 
- [x] Build Tic Tac Toe
- [x] Integrate into one site
- [x] Add multiplayer functionality to Tic-Tac-Toe using websockets. 
- [ ] Allow multiple Tic-Tac-Toe games at once
- [ ] Deploy
- [ ] Refactor frontend into SPA, likely using Vue
